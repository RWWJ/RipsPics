  <h2>Color a layer</h2>

  <h3>Here is a layer exercise you might find fun. We're going to hand color a Black and White photo.</h3>

  <p>First get yourself a B&W image. If you don't already have one, take one of your color images and do a quick black and white conversion (use "de-saturate" or "Convert to black and white"). I know I know, why colorize a black and white photo if you already have the color original? Remember I said this is to be a fun exercise.</p>
  <p>Now create a new (empty) layer by clicking on the New Layer icon at the bottom of your Layers palette (paper with folded corner). Change this new layer's blending mode to "Color". Set the layer opacity to about 40%. Rename the layer to "Color" by double clicking the layers default name of "Layer 1".</p>
  <p>Select a large soft brush. Set the color to something bright. Start painting, changing color as desired for different areas of the image. Don't worry too much about getting paint where "it doesn't belong". You will find that your paint won't stick to the dark black and very white areas, leaving a less than perfect paint job looking like you stayed within the lines.</p>

  <h2>LOCAL CONTRAST</h2>

  <h3>Frequently photos need a little more contrast</h3>

  <p>Frequently photos need a little more contrast, however sometimes you find using Brightness/Contrast, Levels, or even Curves, results in the darks becoming to dark and the highlights getting a bit to, well a bit to highlighty.</p>
  <p>In these instances a Local Contrast adjustment may come to your rescue.</p>
  <p>Local Contrast is essentially an over the top application of the unSharp mask.</p>
  <p>To give it a try, duplicate your image layer (^J). Start up the unSharp mask filter. A good starting point for the values are, Amount = 50 (closer to 100 for more intensity), Radius = 20, Threshold = 1 (perhaps 2 or 3 if you find noise becoming more visible). The Amount setting is the main value you want to play around with to vary the look and contrast of your image.</p>
