  <h2>EDIT COMPARISONS</h2>
    <p>This technique will let us compare four adjustments to our image.</p>

    <p>Editing topics covered, include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Guide lines</li>
      <li>Selections</li>
      <li>Masking</li>
      <li>Adjustment layers</li>
      <li>Layer styles (effects)</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>GUIDE LINES</h3>
    <p>First we'll setup to make creating the four masks easier.</p>

    <p>Make sure in the View menu that Snap is checked (enabled) and that everything in Snap To
    is checked (enabled)</p>

    <p>Lets create two guide lines, one vertically down the center of the image and one horizontally
    across the center of the image.
    <br>These are only guides, they do not show up in your saved
    image. When we use the selection tool, our selections our will snap to these guides.</p>

    <div class="ContainerImgLeft">
      <img class="ImgLeft" width="100%" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/GuideLines.png" alt="">
      <div class="TextRight">
        <p>Click in the left side ruler area and drag across to the center of the image (aproximate is
          fine). That should leave a cyan guide line down the center of your image.</p>

        <p>Similarly, drag from the top ruler down to center of the iamge.</p>

        <p>If all is right, you should have two cyan lines breaking your image into four sections.</p>
      </div>  <!-- END TextRight -->
    </div>  <!-- END ContainerImgLeft -->

  <h3>SELECTION</h3>
    <div class="ContainerImgNarrowLeft">
      <img class="ImgLeft" width="100%" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/ToolBar.png" alt="">
      <div class="TextRight">
        <p>Choose your rectangular marquee tool (selection tool) from the Tools panel.</p>
        <div class="ContainerImgLeft">
          <img class="ImgLeft" width="100%" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/Selection.png" alt="">
          <div class="TextRight">
          <p>Create the first of four selctions, by clicking in the center of your image (where the
            guide lines cross) and drag to the upper left corner of the image. If you get close enough
            to the guide lines, the selction will snap to the lines.</p>
          </div>  <!-- END TextRight -->
        </div>  <!-- END ContainerImgLeft -->
      </div>  <!-- END TextRight -->
    </div>  <!-- END ContainerImgLeft -->

  <h3>COLOR LUT (Look Up Table)</h3>
    <p>Add an adjustment layer of Color Lookup.</p>
    <p>Do that by clicking the black and white circle icon at the bottom of your Layers panel, then selecting Color Lookup.
     If you prefer using the menu, it's under Layer, New Adjustment Layer, Color Lookup</p>
     <img width="300px" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/LayersPanelIcons.png" alt="">

    <p>When the adjustment layer is added, a mask is automatically created for it using the
    current selection.</p>

    <div class="ContainerImgLeft">
      <img class="ImgLeft" width="100%" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/ColorLookupProperties.png" alt="">
      <div class="TextRight">
        <p>In the Properties window that pops up for the Color Lookup, Try all the different presets
        until you find one you like (ignore the Load...).</p>

        <p>You can close the Properties window to get it out of your way.</p>
      </div>  <!-- END TextRight -->
    </div>  <!-- END ContainerImgLeft -->


  <h3>STROKE</h3>
    <p>To visibly seperate our adjustments, we'll outline them.</p>

    <div class="ContainerImgLeft">
      <img class="ImgLeft" width="100%" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/LayersPanelIcons.png" alt="">
      <div class="TextRight">
        <p>Add a thick Stroke around this adjustment, by selcting Stroke from the fx
            Style icon at the bottom of your Layers Panel.
        Or from the menu (Layer, Layer Styles).</p>
      </div>  <!-- END TextRight -->
    </div>  <!-- END ContainerImgLeft -->

    <div class="ContainerImgLeft">
      <img class="ImgLeft" width="100%" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/LayerStyleWindow.png" alt="">
      <div class="TextRight">
        <p>In the Layer Styles window that comes up, change the Size of the Stroke to something in the range
          of maybe 10 to 30px (not too thick, but thick enough to create a nice border).
          Feel free to change the Color if you'd prefer something other than black.</p>

        <p>Change the Postition to Inside (Outside is the default). This is so our Strokes do not overlap.</p>

        <p>The Stroke (and other styles in this window) are applied to the mask of the current layer.</p>
        <p>Feel free to try styles other than (or along with) Stroke. For example, Drop Shadow may look
        good as well.</p>
      </div>  <!-- END TextRight -->
    </div>  <!-- END ContainerImgLeft -->


  <h3>REPEAT</h3>
    <p>Now repeat the previous three steps, Selection, Color lookup, and Stroke, three more times,
    for the upper right, lower left and lower right sections of the image. Each time choosing a
    different Color Lookup preset for a different look.</p>

  <h3>FINAL IMAGE</h3>
    <p>To see the final effect, pres Ctrl-; (or Cmd-; on Mac) to turn off the Cyan guide lines.
    Or in the menu go to, View, Show, Guides, to toggle off the Cyan guide lines.</p>

    <p>Don't forget to save your work!</p>

  <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <p>Your final edit may look something like this:</p>
    <img width="500px" src="TutorialsPhotoshop/ImagesEditComparisons/FinalImage.png" alt="">

    <p>So, we used Guide lines to mark off the image in quarters, created a selections, added an adjustment layers,
    and put a strokes around the areas.</p>

    <p>Aside from practicing a few different editing techniques, this is a good way to be able to compare
    four different adjustments to your image and see which like best.</p>
