		EDITING MASKS

by Ray Wallace

When working on a layer mask, it is sometimes difficult to tell where you've painted
on it and where you haven't. This is especially the case when you are masking some
subtle affect. In these cases, it is useful to look at the mask contents it self
(as appose to the effect it is having). There are two ways to do this:
   1. <ALT> click on the mask icon. This will display the mask in place of your image.
	To return to the normal image view, just <ALT> click on the icon again.

   2. Press the \ (backslash) key. This will switch you into Quick Mask mode, which
	displays a translucent pink overlay on the image. Press the \ (backslash) key
	again to return to just seeing the image.

In both of these states, you can continue editing (i.e. painting on) the mask, or you
can return to the "normal" state before continuing to work on the mask.
