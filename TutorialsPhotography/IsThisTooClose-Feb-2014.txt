			Is this too close?
			by Ray Wallace

A photographer friend posted a closeup of her model's lovely face and
was wondering "what is considered to be too close?"

In the end you want a great image and there is not one thing that makes an image great.

How close or far away you are (or the crop is) does not make it a good or bad image.
It is however one aspect of what the image will look like (i.e. will it be great).

Whether the main part of your subject is on a third or not (rule of thirds) does not make
or break the image. It does however affect the look.

Having a leading line (diagonal, ess curve, etc...) can change the look of your image,
but is not a requirement for a great photo.

Having an interesting foreground, middle, and background is cool, but not all great
images have all three.

So what makes a great image? 

Getting first place in a competition might indicate that it is a great image...on
the other hand a different group of judges may not even place that same image.

Following some of the rules (like the ones mentioned above) might help,
but they might also hinder or clash with other rules or aspects of the image.
You really need to look at the over all image to determine if it is a great photo.
If it is a great photo, then you were, not "too close"!


In the end, the greatness and value of a photograph (printed or otherwise),
depends on whether the client likes it. The "client", could be you, a judge,
a potential purchaser, someone who commissioned the photo, etc... If the
client likes it, then it's a great image, regardless of how many rules you used or
broke in the image.

Keep on shooting (great) photos!
