<h2>Is this too close?</h2>

<h3>A photographer friend posted a closeup of her model's face and
asked "What is considered to be too close?"</h3>

<p>In the end you want a great image and there is not one thing that makes an image great.</p>

<p>How close or far away you are (or the crop is) does not make it a good or bad image.
It is however one aspect of what the image will look like (i.e. will it be great).</p>

<p>Whether the main part of your subject is on a third or not (rule of thirds) does not make
or break the image. It does however affect the look.</p>

<p>Having a leading line (diagonal, S-curve, etc...) can change the look of your image,
but is not a requirement for a great photo.</p>

<p>Having an interesting foreground, middle, and background is cool, but not all great
images have all three.</p>

<p>So what makes a great image? </p>

<p>Getting first place in a competition might indicate that it is a great image...on
the other hand a different group of judges may not even place that same image.</p>

<p>Following some of the rules (like the ones mentioned above) might help,
but they might also hinder or clash with other rules or aspects of the image.</p>
You really need to look at the over all image to determine if it is a great photo.
If it is a great photo, then you were, not "too close"!


<p>In the end, the greatness and value of a photograph (printed or otherwise),
depends on whether the client likes it. The "client", could be you, a judge,</p>
a potential purchaser, someone who commissioned the photo, etc... If the
client likes it, then it's a great image, regardless of how many rules you used or
broke in the image.

Keep on shooting (great) photos!
