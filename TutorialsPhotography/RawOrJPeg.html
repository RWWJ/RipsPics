  <h2>Is it better to shoot in RAW or Jpeg?</h2>

  <p>The "correct" answer is not a short one.</p></p>

  <p>For example, one of our club members was once told he should shoot RAW,
  so on his next photo trip he shot exclusively raw and when he returned home
  he was not able to view (or process) the RAW files. When he eventually acquired
  the software to do the conversion from RAW to jpeg, he found it to be a pain in the lens,
  enticing him to switch back to shooting jpeg.</p>

  <p>So in contrast to a lot of photographers who simply and adamantly admonish
  "You should always shoot RAW!", my answer goes like this:</p>

  <p>If you are not familiar with using RAW files, then don't stop
  shooting jpeg until you have master (or gotten good at) processing
  RAW files. Possibly the best way to learn to use RAW files is
  to set your camera to save BOTH jpeg and RAW versions of the
  images you take. If your camera does not have this setting, then
  set your camera to save RAW, take some test photos, set the camera
  back to saving jpeg (i.e. what your used to) then go work on processing
  those RAW test images. Keep doing that until you're comfortable with
  processing RAW and you realize that RAW is the way to  go.</p>

  <p>There are even some photographers who like RAW that have their camera
  set to save both the RAW and jpeg versions.
  Then if they are happy with the jpeg file, they just use it and don't
  "bother" with the RAW. Everyone needs to figure out what works
  best for their style, expertise, and workflow.</p>

  <p>If you are now to the point where you can competently and happily
  deal with RAW image files, then the answer to the original
  question may have become obvious to you; You should shoot in RAW,
  since RAW image files have more detail and flexibility than jpeg!</p>

  <p>If it isn't obvious, then that statement may not do you as much good
  as it should, so let me explain...</p>

  <p>Your camera will store much more image date in a RAW file than
  it can in a jpeg file. Most significantly, more data (detail)
  is stored in the highlight portion of the image (whites) and in the
  shadow portion of the image (blacks). Such that if you were to have
  your camera save both the RAW and jpeg versions of an image and
  the jpeg had overexposed (blown out) highlights, you may be able to
  "recover" some or all of the "lost" data in the highlights by
  processing the RAW file appropriately. You may in fact be able to
  "recover" up to a couple of stops worth of image information,
  depending on the particular camera, conversion software, and technique
  (i.e. skill in using the RAW to jpeg conversion software).</p>

  <p>Another aspect of RAW files that make them better than jpeg is that
  RAW files hold more information for any given pixel in the image than
  jpeg files can. Jpeg files can hold a value from 0 to 255 for each of
  the red, green, and blue parts of a pixel. Whereas a RAW file can hold
  a value of 0 to 4095 for each of the pixel components (or more depending
  on the particular camera).</p>

  <p>And yet a third difference between the two formats is that jpeg files are
  compressed (to make them smaller) in such a way that some pixel detail
  is thrown away and "lost". Which is why jpeg is called a lossy file format.</p>

  <p>If you need more reasons; If you get the white balance "wrong", you have
  a LOT more leeway changing it in a RAW file than adjusting it in a jpeg.
  In fact RAW files do not have the white balance applied to them, though
  the white balance information from the camera is stored in the RAW file,
  it is only a suggestion for the conversion software, whereas the jpeg file
  will already have all its image data adjusted based on the white balance
  setting, so you can lose some detail when you adjust the white balance
  of a jpeg on your computer.</p>

  <p>Wow, ok, that may seem like too much information, but in fact there is
  a lot of detail I left out. Although I do believe I included enough detail for
  each of you to decide whether you should use RAW or jpeg (or both) today,
  or tomorrow, or....</p>

  <p>I should add...Not everyone realizes that you're camera most likely came with software
  that does the RAW to jpeg conversion. For Canon that is Digital Photo Professional,
  for Nikon it is ViewNX. So you don't need to own Elements or Photoshop to use RAW
  files.<p>

  Keep on shooting!
