  <h2>Priorities</h2>

  <h3>When is it best to set your camera on Shutter Priority and when on Aperture Priority?</h3>

  <p>Getting your priorities right is not always easy, so lets talk a bit about Aperture Priority (AV or A) and Shutter Priority (TV or S).</p>
  <p>Think about speed and depth of field of the subject you are about to photograph. If the image is static then you may not care about shutter speed. If you are trying to capture objects both near to the camera and far away, then you are probably interested in controlling depth of field.</p>
  <p>Set your camera to Shutter Priority when you care about speed, set it to Aperture Priority when you care about depth of field.</p>
  <p>For example if you are shooting a bicycle race, you probably want to use Shutter Priority and set your shutter speed up fairly high to freeze the motion of the bikers so they are not blurry. Let the camera change the aperture to whatever it calculates it needs for a good exposure.</p>
  <p>For a photo of a hiker with mountains in the background, you likely want to use Aperture Priority, setting the f/stop fairly high for a small aperture and large depth of field; leaving the camera to set the shutter speed for a correct exposure.</p>

  <h2>Manual</h2>

  <h3>I'm still not completely comfortable using manual settings so I often use shutter or aperture priority.  I'm not sure that I'm always making the best choice.</h3>

  <p>Getting off of full auto and onto Shutter Priority or Aperture Priority is a great way to wrestle some control from your camera. Sometimes however, switching to Manual is an even better choice when your lighting is constant but the subject or background tones vary.</p>
  <p>Your camera determines exposure by assuming that the tones in every scene average out to a 50% grey. That is a good guess that frequently gets you close enough to a good exposure. However, in cases where a large percentage of a scene is black, the camera will overexpose the image (trying to brighten the black into a grey). In the case of a high percentage of white, the camera metering system will underexpose the image (attempting to make it grey).</p>
